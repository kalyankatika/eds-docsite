# About Our Design System

Our design system provides a comprehensive set of components, guidelines, and resources to help build consistent and user-friendly interfaces across all our products.

## Our Mission

We aim to create a unified design language that improves user experience, increases development efficiency, and ensures consistent brand representation across all digital touchpoints.

## History

This design system is the result of merging three legacy documentation sites into a single, cohesive resource. We've preserved backward compatibility while modernizing the interface and improving usability.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Ready-to-use UI components with examples and documentation
- **Design Guidelines**: Clear standards for typography, color, spacing, and more
- **Legacy Support**: Access to components from previous design systems
- **Responsive Design**: All components work across different screen sizes and devices

## The Team

Our design system is maintained by a cross-functional team of designers and developers dedicated to improving our product experience.
